custom minecraft (1.18.2 but can be used in newer versions) plugin written in java using spigot and maven

It's a game you can play with at least 2 players! The goal is to kill as many targets as possible to gain poits before time runs out! Compass shows your target and updates every 5 seconds. 
The more you kill, the better loot you get! Game lasts 15 minutes and is easly scaleable to unlimited players!
Look for airdrops (chest spwan at 11, 7 and  3 minute) with amazing loot! (big arrow aperars on the sky and if you are close to chest, it glows!)
Keep and eye for worldboarder too! As time flyes by it's get smaller!

And remember, if you have a bad day, you will get some extra items to fight back! ;)

Have a good time!
